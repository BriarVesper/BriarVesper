### Hi, I'm @BriarVesper!

I'm a professional full-stack developer with an eye for the artistic. I work primarily in Cloud-based web development, though I have branched out into DevSecOps and Machine Learning on my own time. I primarily work with JavaScript (and related frameworks: NodeJS, React, etc...), with plenty of experience in CSS (LESS and SASS especially). My day to day involves heavy use of AWS, but I've been mainly focusing on MERN on my own time.

##### Interests
Outside of development, I love arthouse cinema (Ingmar Bergman, Věra Chytilová, Claire Denis, Andrei Tarkovsky), reading (Fiction: Madeline Miller, Seth Dickinson, N.K. Jemisin, Katherine Arden. Non-fiction: Jocko Willink, Carl Sagan), gaming (Monster Hunter, Shin Megami Tensei, Legend of Zelda, Metal Gear Solid) and photography (I don't really have any favorite photographers, I just enjoy it).

##### Learning
I'm currently in the process of learning and refining:
* MERN stack
* Machine learning
* Ethical hacking
